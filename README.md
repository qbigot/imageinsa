## ImageINSA

ImageINSA is an image processing application geared toward teaching and algorithm demonstrations.
ImageINSA is based upon the library ImageIn for image manipulations;
The application's interface is also based on the [DETIQ-T][1]'s generic interface.

Both ImageIn and the generic interface are part of the project [DETIQ-T][1].
